It\\'s becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately . I\\'m not sure whether it\\'s Brie Larson\\'s underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing .  2019\\'s \"Captain Marvel\" wasn\\'t too bad for a superhero movie, but its sequel \"The Marvels\" is an unmitigated stinking disaster . Director Nia DaCosta creates a headache inducing, fast (as if bizarrely sped up), frantic, thoroughly annoying, tiresome piece of garbage .  I am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office .

I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could\\'ve got much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket It\\'s hard to find any plot to this movie . The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it\\'s so bad and some people walked out of the theatre .  I just watched it on Disney+ now that it\\'s available and it wasn\\'t terrible at all . I didn\\'t get around to seeing it in theaters . It was more childish at times (following the theme of the show that includes the same child main character)  I thought that this film was pretty good, though I have to agree that the problem is that you do need to catch up to speed to understand what is going on . Mind you, I did actually quite like the film. Like the scenes where they were switching places whenever they used their powers together, and also the big bad in the film, that was in part trying to save her people .  I avoided the movie for over half a year due to the negative reviews and my own marvel-burnout . I say this to establish how low my expectations were . This was never going for an oscar or trying to usurp Infinity War in terms of \"depth\"  My biggest challenge were equally two of my favorite things in the film . For those who don\\'t watch Disney+ two (more actually) of the primary characters were unknown to theatre audiences . Somewhere in here was a much stronger film than we, the audience, were able to see .  Overall I enjoyed the movie and found it a decent watch enjoyable superhero entertainer movie . The three main cast of the movie are the highlight and their bonding is superb . Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan (Ms Marvel) is by far the best portayed character ever and does a great job once again doing that character well .  I really don\\'t understand the hate this movie received . It is a fun romp through the universe with great action, decent humor and some really heart felt moments . We see more emotion from a Carol who\\'s not the cocksure pilot from the first movie .  I would have skipped this one if the trailer didn\\'t look like so much fun . The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy . It is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel .  This movie has serious cult film potential . If you haven\\'t seen Ms Marvel, Captain Marvel and Wandavision, it will make very little sense . Beyond this, the flerkens had me laughing until I cried .  I really enjoyed this movie better than a lot of the recent superhero movies . I noticed some were moaning about Miss Marvel being juvenile but that\\'s the point of her she\\'s a teenager .  I believe the movie is unfairly treated and that included me as well . The trailers don\\'t do this movie much justice and the marketing was also poor .  Iman Vellani continues to be a delight, with Kamala Khan\\'s character and family providing both the grounded heart of the film and many of its funniest moments . The villain of the piece is one of the least notable Marvel antagonists so far . '}\n"
